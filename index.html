    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p> I wanted to upgrade my calculator because I enjoyed working on this project and had many ideas. I wanted a calculator that looked good but also functioned properly. 
    Next, I wanted to make sure the calculator was easy to use. I sketched out some designs and asked my friends what they thought. Their feedback helped me figure
    out where the buttons should go and how to set up the buttons so it would be easier to understand and that the buttons would make sense. </p>

<p> For the look of the calculator, I really wanted it to look simple and easy to understand. I used different styles, colors, and different layouts that made the calculator
    make sense and make it look good. A tool that helped out a lot for this was a wireframe tool because I got to make a design for it, even though my wireframe design doesn't 
    look like my calculator, I still think it looks good after the changes from the wireframe. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the process of redseigning the calculator was really fun and enjoyable. It was probably one of the funnest projects I have made in this class because
   we had lots of time to work on it to improve it. I got lots of help from different people and sources to help me out but i think the final product turned out great,
   I do wish I could add some more styling and maybe a graphing calculator option using a library but that can be done another time.</p>

    <h2>ISSUES</h2>
<p> When I created this calculator, I struggled the most with adding parentheses. I could not figure out how to implement them properly. My main issue was that I
    kept bouncing around, trying to manage multiple tasks at once. I remember one time I was trying to understand Pi, keyboard functionality, and my backspace button
    all simultaneously. I kept getting distracted and worked on other functions when I had one nearly complete. I had to improve the calculation function because the 
    original code couldn't handle multiple operators, and doing so helped a lot. After all, it made it somewhat easier to code other new functions.</p>
