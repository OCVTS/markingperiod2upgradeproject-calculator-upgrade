<header><h1>Calculator Upgrade</h1></header>
<div id="grid">
<div id="desc">
<p> I wanted to upgrade my calculator because I enjoyed working on this project and had many ideas. I wanted a calculator that looked good but also functioned properly.
    My goal was to make the functionality better and add new features that would work well with my calculator. I tried out different colors, and layouts, aiming for
    a simplistic look that matched what I wanted. I also wanted to add advanced functions that would make sense on a scientific calculator.</p>

<div id="list">
    <h2>All of my calculators functions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Addition</li>
    <li>Subtraction</li>
    <li>Multiplication</li>
    <li>Division</li>
    <li>Exponents</li>
    <li>Square Roots</li>

<p> When I created this calculator, I struggled the most with adding parentheses. I could not figure out how to implement them properly. My main issue was that I
    kept bouncing around, trying to manage multiple tasks at once. I remember one time I was trying to understand Pi, keyboard functionality, and my backspace button
    all simultaneously. I kept getting distracted and worked on other functions when I had one nearly complete. I had to improve the calculation function because the 
    original code couldn't handle multiple operators, and doing so helped a lot. After all, it made it somewhat easier to code other new functions.</p>
